# Product-Client_Analysis
💉A pharmaceutical company was **struggling with client retention and inconsistent product sales**. 

📉 Many products had *long periods without being sold,* which not only reduced revenue but **also made the company overly dependent on a small group of recurring buyers**.

❗This lack of diversification put the company's **long-term growth at risk**.

Using a **sales transactions database**, I applied **Markov Chains** to model **product and client behaviors**. This probabilistic approach allowed me to:

- Estimate the likelihood (*s*) of a product being sold in the next month versus remaining unsold (*1-s*).
- Model client behavior similarly, calculating the probability (*b*) of a customer making a purchase versus not returning (*1-b*).

<aside>

💡 **Markov Chains** are mathematical models that predict the probability of transitioning between different states over time. In this case, products and clients move between "sold/bought" and "unsold/did not buy" states, revealing patterns in purchasing behavior.

By leveraging this approach, I uncovered **key trends in buying patterns**, enabling **data-driven strategic decisions** for product positioning and customer engagement.
